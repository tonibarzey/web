		<h1> Familly Welcoming Time. </h1>
		<p> I reach home to my mansion in port of spain and i fell with excitement of love and overjoyment. I couldn't believe i was amongst family that have wached me grow up simce i was a little girl. They congratulated me on all of my achivements and wanted to celerate my suceess of being a college student. I  suddenly saw some of my older couisns and they decided on taking me out to a club or out to eat and boy did i have to think fast on those two options.I was slighty suffering fom jetlag and a nice nap would do me justice considering the facts that i sat on a plane for 6 hours straight. </p>
